# BankingSystem
this is a project from Jetbrains where I created a simple banking system. I utlize object oriented programming concepts, exception handling, 
and working with a database. I'll use these practiced concepts to develop my books project(https://github.com/Calice-S/Books), where I can add my data to a database 
instead of a .txt file.
